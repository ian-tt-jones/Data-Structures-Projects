The projects in this repository are from the work I did in CMSC 341 - Data Structures in my Undergraduate career at UMBC. Each of these projects is coded in C++ andrepresents a different type of data structure. Each project contains a test file which tests every possible feature of the program from the main components to edge cases. These projects demonstrate a deep understanding of coding in C++ as well as using data structures for diffferent purposes as they are required. 

The first project from Data Structures and Algorithms features a linked list project where each node can have multiple children going north, south east, and west to model a railroad system. 

The second project is an AVL tree project where each node represents a tiger, an endangered species. Each tiger can have different ages and sexes. The tree is self balancing. 

The third project represents a heap, min and max, where each node is a crop. The crops are organized in the heap based on their priority.

The fourth project represents a hash table where we organize different programming languages with different IDs. Not much of a real world example, but this project was good practice.
